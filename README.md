# British Airways Customer Reviews Analysis
Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This project is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present meaningful insights.

Real data was scrapped from skytrax website. The data scrapped is very messy and contains purely text. Data cleaning was performed in order to prepare the data for analysis and uncover insights.
